# Projects

## Wearable

- Devices
- Output
- Data input
- Missing data
- Defining output
- Metrics and trends
    - Increase / Decrease
    - Spikes

## Requirements

- Project shall adhere as close as possible to the Semantic Versioning Specification to describe major changes.
- Changes will be tracked and documented using a version control system (git).
    - To either be hosted 
        1. Preferentially by NVI, or
        2. By Zac (per Zac's choice, currently github.com).
    - If hosted by Zac, the entire repository will be maintained for 90 days during which NVI may request a copy of the entire repository. After 90 days it will be deleted. This period may be shorted or extended by request e.g., by requesting immediate deletion or a retention time of up to 1 year.


## Goals

    - Change in average monthly sleep
- Contain safeguards against missing or corrupted data
- Documentation on solution architecture
- Solution should be maintainable by NVI.
- Solution should be extensible and customizable by NVI where possible.

0.2.0

- Include data from multiple wearable devices
- Augment the metrics being visualized and tracked
